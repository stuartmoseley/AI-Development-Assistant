Collecting workspace informationSure, here is the updated section for the README.md file:

### Using GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4 for Code Completion

The AI Development Assistant uses the GPT-2 model from the `transformers` library by Hugging Face for code completion and snippet suggestions. No API key is required for this implementation. The `transformers` library allows you to download and use pre-trained models directly from Hugging Face's model hub.

If you decide to use OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 models, you will need an API key from OpenAI. The assistant can switch between GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 models based on user input. For GPT-3 and GPT-4, the assistant uses the OpenAI API, and you need to set your OpenAI API key in the code.

To use GPT-3 or GPT-4, modify your code to include the OpenAI API key and select the appropriate model when prompted.

```python
# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
```

When prompted for the model choice, enter `gpt-2`, `gpt-3`, or `gpt-4` to use the respective model for code completion.
